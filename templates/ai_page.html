        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol used to ensure reliable communication over IP networks. It is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is established between the sender and receiver before data is sent. This connection is maintained throughout the duration of the communication, and data is sent in a continuous stream.

        TCP is designed to provide reliable data transfer, which means that it ensures that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. It does this by using a sequence number and acknowledgement mechanism, which allows the sender to track the progress of the data and the receiver to confirm that the data has been received correctly.

        TCP is commonly used for applications that require reliable data transfer, such as file transfers, email, and web browsing. It is also used for real-time applications, such as video streaming and voice over IP (VoIP), where reliability and low latency are critical.

        Some of the key features of TCP include:

        * Connection-oriented: A connection is established between the sender and receiver before data is sent.
        * Reliable: Data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.
        * Scalable: TCP can handle a large number of connections and data streams.
        * Flexible: TCP can adapt to changing network conditions and traffic patterns.
        * Secure: TCP provides security features, such as encryption and authentication, to protect data from unauthorized access.

        Overall, TCP is a widely used and important protocol that enables reliable communication over IP networks.
