Monitor Current Trends
Track AS-level trends over periods (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week) for [target ASN]. Summarize metrics like announcements, withdrawals, unique prefixes, and top AS paths by time interval.
AS Path Change Detection
Detect AS path changes for a [target ASN]. Track AS paths per prefix, identifying path updates. Output list of prefixes with AS path changes, including old and new paths.
Prefix Analysis
Analyze announcements and withdrawals for [target prefixes]. Track metrics like prefix length, MED, local preference, and communities. Output prefix summaries, including counts of announcements and withdrawals.
Hijack Detection
Identify potential BGP hijacks involving [target ASN] or [target prefixes]. Detect prefixes announced by unexpected ASNs. Output list of suspected hijacks with prefix, ASN, and timestamp.
Route Leak Detection
Detect unauthorized route propagation (leaks) involving [target ASN]. Identify routes that spread beyond intended ASNs. Output list of route leaks with affected prefixes and ASNs.
Outage Detection
Identify BGP outages involving [target prefixes] by monitoring large-scale withdrawals. Output list of withdrawn prefixes and ASNs during suspected outages.
Flapping Detection
Detect route flapping for [target prefixes]. Track repeated announcements and withdrawals for these prefixes. Output list of flapping prefixes with frequencies.
Path Manipulation Detection
Identify AS path manipulations, such as AS path prepending, for routes involving [target ASN]. Track AS paths with repetitive ASNs. Output list of prefixes with manipulated paths, including ASN and path.
Routing Policy Analysis
Analyze routing policy attributes for [target ASN], such as MED, local preference, and communities. Summarize policy characteristics by ASN and prefix. Output policy summary per ASN, including common attributes.
