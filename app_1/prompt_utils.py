You are tasked with generating Python scripts that perform various BGP analysis tasks using the pybgpstream library.
Please adhere to the following guidelines when writing the code:
- Define Time Range and Collectors:
The time range as strings in the following format: 
from_time = "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
until_time = "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"

Specify the BGP collectors list and initialize BGPStream with these parameters:
stream = pybgpstream.BGPStream(
        from_time=from_time,
        until_time=until_time,
        record_type="updates",
        collectors=["rrc00", "route-views.amsix"]
    )

- Initialize Counters and Data Structures:
Set up counters and dictionaries for announcements, withdrawals, AS paths, community counts, and MED values:
from collections import defaultdict
announcements = defaultdict(int)
withdrawals = defaultdict(int)
prefix_as_paths = {}
community_counts = defaultdict(int)
med_values = []

- Iterate Over Records and Elements:
for rec in stream.records():
    for elem in rec:
        Processing logic goes here

- Accessing and Validating Element Attributes:
Extract basic element information such as timestamps, element type, and fields:
from datetime import datetime

elem_time = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(elem.time)
elem_type = elem.type 'A' for announcements, 'W' for withdrawals
fields = elem.fields

Retrieve prefix, validate it, and continue if it's absent:
prefix = fields.get("prefix")
if prefix is None:
    continue

Extract AS Path and filter based on the target ASN:
as_path_str = fields.get('as-path', "")
as_path = as_path_str.split()
target_asn = '3356'
if target_asn not in as_path:
    continue

Access additional attributes like Peer ASN, Collector, and Communities:
peer_asn = elem.peer_asn
collector = rec.collector
communities = fields.get('communities', [])

- Filtering and Counting Announcements and Withdrawals:
* Count announcements and withdrawals based on element type:
if elem_type == 'A':
    announcements[prefix] += 1
elif elem_type == 'W':
    withdrawals[prefix] += 1

- Detecting AS Path Changes:
* Track changes in AS paths for each prefix:
if prefix in prefix_as_paths:
    if as_path != prefix_as_paths[prefix]:  # AS path has changed
        # Update the AS path
        prefix_as_paths[prefix] = as_path
else:
    prefix_as_paths[prefix] = as_path

- Analyzing Community Attributes:
Count occurrences of each community string in the communities list:
for community in communities:
    community_str = f"{community[0]}:{community[1]}"
    community_counts[community_str] += 1

- Calculating Statistics (e.g., Average MED):
Retrieve the MED field, add it to a list, and calculate the average:
med = fields.get('med')
if med is not None:
    try:
        med_values.append(int(med))
    except ValueError:
        pass  Ignore invalid MED values

Calculate average MED if values exist
if med_values:
    average_med = sum(med_values) / len(med_values)

You are tasked with generating Python scripts that perform real-time BGP analysis using the pybgpstream library. Please adhere to the following guidelines when writing the code:

- Script Structure
Include a __main__ block or a usage example to demonstrate how to run the script.
Implement time-based stop triggers to gracefully stop data collection and processing after a specified duration.
Use Separate Time Variables for Collection Duration and Metrics Interval
Collection Duration Tracking:
Use collection_start_time to track the total duration of data collection.
Metrics Interval Tracking:
Use a separate interval_start_time to track intervals for periodic tasks like printing metrics.
Do not reset collection_start_time inside loops, as it affects the stop condition.

- Key Processing Guidelines
Initialize BGPStream Without Filters:
stream = pybgpstream.BGPStream(
    project="ris-live",
    record_type="updates",
)
Implement Time-Based Stop Triggers:
import time

collection_start_time = time.time()
interval_start_time = collection_start_time
COLLECTION_DURATION = 300

Checking for Stop Conditions Within the Loop:
while True:
    # Check if the total collection duration has been exceeded
    if time.time() - collection_start_time >= COLLECTION_DURATION:
        break

    for rec in stream.records():

                break
        else:
            continue
        break
Graceful Shutdown:
Ensure that the script can be stopped gracefully after the specified duration or when a stop event is triggered.
Clean up resources, close streams, and terminate processes properly.

- Main Loop Processing
Do not use any filter attributes like stream.add_filter() or set filter parameters when initializing BGPStream.
All filtering and processing should occur within the main loop where you iterate over records and elements.

Handling Potential Blocking in Data Streams:
Be aware that data streams may block if no new data is received.
Implement mechanisms to periodically check stop conditions even when data is not being received.
Consider using timeouts, non-blocking iterators, or running data collection in a separate thread or process.

- Anomaly Detection Tasks
Implement functions or logic within the main loop to detect:
Hijacks:
Compare the observed origin AS with the expected origin AS for target prefixes.
Example:

expected_origins = {'192.0.2.0/24': '64500', '198.51.100.0/24': '64501'}
observed_origin = as_path[-1] if as_path else None
expected_origin = expected_origins.get(prefix)
if expected_origin and observed_origin != expected_origin:
    print(f"Possible hijack detected for {prefix}: expected {expected_origin}, observed {observed_origin}")

Outages:
Monitor for sustained withdrawals of prefixes without re-announcements.
Keep track of withdrawn prefixes and their timestamps.
Example:

from datetime import datetime, timedelta

withdrawals_timestamps = {}

if elem_type == 'W':
    withdrawals_timestamps[prefix] = datetime.utcnow()
elif elem_type == 'A' and prefix in withdrawals_timestamps:
    del withdrawals_timestamps[prefix]

outage_threshold = timedelta(minutes=30)
current_time = datetime.utcnow()
for prefix, withdrawal_time in list(withdrawals_timestamps.items()):
    if current_time - withdrawal_time > outage_threshold:
        # Outage detected
        print(f"Outage detected for {prefix} since {withdrawal_time}")
        del withdrawals_timestamps[prefix]


MOAS (Multiple Origin AS) Conflicts:
Monitor prefixes announced by multiple origin ASNs.
Example:
prefix_origins = defaultdict(set)

origin_asn = as_path[-1] if as_path else None
if origin_asn:
    prefix_origins[prefix].add(origin_asn)
    if len(prefix_origins[prefix]) > 1:
        origins = ', '.join(prefix_origins[prefix])
        print(f"MOAS conflict for {prefix}: announced by ASNs {origins}")

AS Path Prepending:
Detect AS path prepending by identifying consecutive repeated ASNs in the AS path.
Example:
prepending_counts = defaultdict(int)
last_asn = None
consecutive_count = 1

for asn in as_path:
    if asn == last_asn:
        consecutive_count += 1
    else:
        if consecutive_count > 1:
            prepending_counts[last_asn] += consecutive_count - 1
        consecutive_count = 1
    last_asn = asn

Handle the last ASN in the path
if consecutive_count > 1 and last_asn:
    prepending_counts[last_asn] += consecutive_count - 1

Report ASes performing prepending
for asn, count in prepending_counts.items():
    print(f"ASN {asn} prepended {count} times")
